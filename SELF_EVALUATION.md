# Self Evaluation ‚Äî Mini Task Management Dashboard

## Summary

This project fulfills all the requirements of the Mini Task Management Dashboard assignment:

- A clean and responsive **3-column task board** (‚ÄúTo Do‚Äù, ‚ÄúIn Progress‚Äù, ‚ÄúDone‚Äù)
- Ability to **add**, **update**, and **reorder tasks**
- Full **API integration** with mock persistence using `json-server`
- Implementation of **drag-and-drop** using `@dnd-kit`
- Use of **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **React best practices** for performance and reusability

The architecture follows a modular and scalable component-driven approach with an emphasis on readability, reusability, and clarity.

## What Went Well

-  **Clear architecture:** Each component serves a single responsibility, making the code easy to navigate and maintain.  
-  **Optimistic UI updates:** Tasks update instantly while API calls resolve in the background.  
-  **Reusable components:** Common UI elements (Button, Modal, Badge, Card) are designed for reusability.  
-  **Performance optimization:** Leveraged `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders during drag-and-drop operations.  
-  **Responsive and accessible UI:** TailwindCSS makes the interface adaptive to different screen sizes and accessible via semantic HTML.  
-  **Smooth DnD interactions:** Implemented column reordering, status updates, and drop feedback using `@dnd-kit`.  
-  **Developer Experience:** Strong TypeScript typing, consistent naming conventions, and error handling improve reliability.

## Challenges Faced

1. **React Strict Mode Double API Calls:**  
   In development, React 18 triggers effects twice, causing duplicate API fetches.  
   Solution: Left StrictMode on for correctness testing but noted it in the documentation.

2. **Drag-and-drop reactivity:**  
   DnDKit‚Äôs data flow required careful handling of state updates to prevent flicker and maintain correct indices.

3. **Dropdown flicker during selection:**  
   Minor re-render flicker when interacting with select elements ‚Äî related to DnD overlay behavior.

4. **Tailwind setup with Vite (latest plugin version):**  
   Followed the latest `@tailwindcss/vite` setup instructions (no `tailwind.config.js` needed) for simplicity and modern alignment.

---

## Self-Criticism

- Some handlers (e.g., DnD reordering) could be abstracted into **custom hooks** for cleaner separation.
- The **New Task Modal** could use controlled form validation rather than inline validation logic.
- No **unit or integration tests** were implemented due to time constraints ‚Äî adding these would strengthen reliability.
- Minor **UI flicker** on dropdown changes could be further refined with `DragOverlay` memoization.
- Currently using **json-server**; a real backend or GraphQL API could make it more robust.

---

## Improvements (If Given More Time)

-  Implement **task editing** (inline or via modal)
-  Add **search and filtering** for large task sets
-  Use **localStorage caching** for offline mode
-  Add **unit tests** using Jest + React Testing Library
-  Add **Framer Motion** animations for smoother drag transitions
-  Introduce a **custom hook** for managing DnD logic and API synchronization
-  Support for **multi-user or priority tagging**

## Technology Rating (Self-Assessment)

| Technology / Skill             | Rating (Out of 10) | Notes |
|--------------------------------|---------------------|--------|
| **React (Hooks, State, DnD)** | 9 / 10 | Confident in modern React patterns, context, and DnD handling |
| **TypeScript** | 8.5 / 10 | Strong typing and prop inference; minor generic improvements possible |
| **API Integration (fetch/json-server)** | 9 / 10 | Proper async flows, error handling, and optimistic updates |
| **CSS / TailwindCSS** | 9 / 10 | Fully responsive, clean utility-based design |
| **Code Architecture & Readability** | 9.5 / 10 | Clear structure, consistent naming, reusable components |
| **Testing & Tooling** | 7 / 10 | Would add Jest/RTL tests with more time |

## üßæ Final Reflection

This project demonstrates:
- Clean, modular, and **production-grade React + TypeScript development**
- Mastery of **state management**, **async APIs**, and **component reusability**
- Thoughtful **UX and performance optimizations**
- Awareness of real-world dev nuances like React StrictMode and DnD edge cases

If given more time, I would focus on polishing micro-interactions, integrating more robust form validation, and adding automated tests ‚Äî but I‚Äôm very happy with how polished, performant, and maintainable the current implementation is.
